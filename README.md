# JefferyBot

An open source, customizable discord bot, made with the discord.js framework.

## Discord

[![JS-D-BOT Server](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/424116223362465794/widget.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/782zeM9)

The official JefferyBot server with the master version of Jeffery running live

## Installation

To run JefferyBot, first you must install node. Then run cd to the install directory, then run `npm install` and all of Jeffery's dependencies will automatically install. The first time you run Jeffery it wil instantly exit, a configuration file will be created in the resources folder, a child to the root directory. 

In config.json you must put your bot's token, and the rest is self explanitory.

Once you have set up the config file, run `node main.js` inside the JefferyBot directory and Jeffery will be running. Then in discord, in a server that your copy of Jeffery is in you can run +help for an extensive list of commands.
